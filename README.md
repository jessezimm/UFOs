# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to document UFO sightings and filter them based on demographic information.

## Results
To perform a search, you simply type in the fields: date, city, state, country, and shape. The data populates with your filters on.

## Summary

### Drawback
You cannot search two dates at one time. Thus, you cannot see the UFO sightings over a given time period.

### Future Improvements
A column in the data that displays images of the UFO sightings would be a beneficial addition to the webpage. Therefore, a user would determine if multiple data entries are linked to the same UFO. Additionally, recalling the drawback mentioned above, enabling the webpage to filter on multiple dates, cities, and other columns would improve the functionality and usability of the webpage.
